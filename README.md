# CS-210

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
Write a program to teach students the concepts of fiscal responsibility with an interactive system. This project shows
The power of compound interest.

# What did you do particularly well
I think I did a good job of seperating my code into objects and keeping main as small as possible in this project.

# Where could you enhance your code?
I would seperate the print functions into different compound interest functions. One to calculate based on years and another to make it based on months
This would make the functions much smaller. I feel like those are the biggest weaknesses of this project.

# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you
# adding to your support netowrk?
Getting used to using c++ exceptions was quite different than what I was used to. I made extensive use of cplusplus.com as well
as stackoverflow looking for examples and better practices to use.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects/or course work?
Getting practicle examples of exceptions and more practice with objects will no doubt help me in future classes and jobs

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
By keeping the code in seperate files and with well written comment blocks before functions and inline comments to explain flow
as well as making it a class so that it is easy to expand on or for another class to inherit from to make use of it in the future.
